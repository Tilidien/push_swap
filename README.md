Solution to the 42 project "push_swap"
Written in accordance with the pesky "norm"

Used Sorting algoryhm is quicksort. I wanted to combine it with premade bruteforced algorythms for lower blocksizes as optimization but norminette didnt like it, so you will only find my handwritten predefined algorythms.

HOW TO USE
Clone and make. Execute with set of numbers. Best used with one of the many visualizers for this project.
